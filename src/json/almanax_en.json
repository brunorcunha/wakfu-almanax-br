She hates people that don't watch their figures! She tries to reign in big eaters by cutting their appetite - even if they've only had one measly forkful. As for the very greediest disciples, she heaps their spoons high so they get full faster!","img":"http://staticns.ankama.com/krosmoz/img/uploads/event/147/boss_all_96_128.png","effect":"Today, your stomach size will be reduced by half... Yes, even if you're a Gobball! A few grains of good rice will be enough to fill up tummies which are usually growling with hunger... You might even be so full you need to let out a great big burp or two! Don't worry, the extra pounds you piled on over Kwismas will keep you going!"},"trivia":"Xav the Baker gave the Brotherhood of the Tofu a very special thank you present in return for their help: he made them breakfast!

Which socks with these trousers? Hair down or in a ponytail? Or a bun?! Turn the world's uncertainty into profit by convincing people that they need useless gadgets at \"bargain prices\"... Yeah, it's dodgy dealing, but so what? Que sera sera!"},"trivia":"Mylaise, an Ecaflip from the Dofus Age, is one of the three Love Priestesses. As Granny Candy's right-hand woman, her number one goal is to prove that you can be girly and powerful at the same time!
